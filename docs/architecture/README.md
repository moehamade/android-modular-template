## What is an ADR?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help team members understand why certain choices were made and provide historical context for future decisions.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation leading to the decision
- **Decision**: The chosen approach
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs, impacts, and implications
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
